# UI Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
Visual Design: Gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and a modern color palette make the portfolio visually appealing.

Micro-Interactions: Subtle animations like hover effects and smooth scaling transitions enhance user interaction.

Usability: Clean layout with responsive design ensures accessibility across devices.

Focus on App Interfaces: Projects showcase app designs with descriptions highlighting unique features.

This design can be expanded with more animations, interactive previews of your app designs, or even embedded videos! Would you like to enhance this further?
This project involves the reverse engineering of a portfolio website. The goal was to break down an existing website design and recreate its features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We, as a team, worked together to recreate the structure, layout, and interactivity of the given design. Our final answers are in the **main branch**


The initial web design was provided to us as a set of images. Our task was to reverse engineer the design, writing the necessary code to recreate it while ensuring responsiveness, functionality, and a smooth user experience.
